# Xapian developer guide

This is the source for [Xapian's developer
guide](https://xapian-developer-guide.readthedocs.org/).
Eventually this repository will be merged into the main Xapian tree.

Join in on channel #xapian on irc.freenode.net (webchat link:
https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23xapian) or via [our
mailing lists](https://xapian.org/lists).

You will need the [Sphinx documentation tool](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
installed to process the documentation. You can install the `python-sphinx`
package on Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu, or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
to install the python package directly.

You can then build the HTML output by running `make html`.
