Licensing your contributions
----------------------------

If you want a patch to be considered for inclusion in Xapian, you
must own the copyright on your changes.  Employers often claim copyright on code
written by their employees (even if the code is written in their spare time),
so please check with your employer if this applies.  Be aware that even if you
are a student your university may try and claim some rights on code which you
write.

Patches which are submitted to Xapian will only be included if the
copyright holder(s) dual-license them under each of the following
licences:

 - GPL version 2 and all later versions (see the file `COPYING`_
   in ``xapian-core`` for details).
 - MIT/X license::

    Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holders>

    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
    FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS
    IN THE SOFTWARE.

The current distribution of Xapian contains many files which are only licensed
under the GPL, but we are working towards being able to distribute Xapian under
a more permissive license, and are not willing to accept patches which we will
have to rewrite before this can happen.
